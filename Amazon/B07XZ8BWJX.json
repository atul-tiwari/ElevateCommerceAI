Great For Exercise Or Walking! Not The Highest Quality Though!","body":"I'm not a shoe expert, so I won't talk like one. I am simply here to tell you like it is. You can easily pay hundreds of dollars for a pair of shoes that are much higher quality, and may also provide a higher quality fit, and long life durability. These however are less then 50 bucks, so your probably not going to get that long life durability, or extreme toughness.  What you will get however, is a shoe made relatively well for the price, with air ride suspension, and fashionable looks. Some people want sneakers for running or jogging only, more power to them. I however, just needed a pair of sneakers with air ride suspension, so that I could have a more comfortable shoe, when walking for a couple miles. These are exactly what I was looking for, and for an affordable price.  The quality of fit is just about right, its just a bit tight in the width. But like with every shoe, there is a break-in period. After wearing them for only 30-minutes, I immediately started noticing the fit getting a bit looser! The more I wear them, the better they are starting to fit. Also, it was so nice to have air ride again, my last pair of Sketchers didn't have that, and walking even a couple of miles was painful with my old shoes. The air ride allows me to walk the same couple of miles a lot easier.  What also helps with the fit, is my recommendation to get 1 size up then your actual shoe size. It will leave you a little room at the toe, especially useful if you haven't been cutting your toenails regularly lol. And the shoe will be a tad wider as well. If you get your exact shoe size, just expect it will fit tight, and require break-in before the shoe feels right. These shoes feel great to walk in, plus I love the styling as well. Shoe laces are average quality as well, although I prefer round laces, the flat ones work ok.  And lastly, if you care about traction, these sneakers have traction, they will grip really well. I recommend these shoes, and I am going to have to give them a 5 out of 5.Read more","asin":"B07XZ8BWJX","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\">             <span>I'm not a shoe expert, so I won't talk like one.

great but...","body":"I've had these shoes for a few years now. There's a few things i want people to know about them. Firstly, they look great. I don't wear mine often so mine still literally look brand new. I have a lot of shoes i wear dependant on my mood, color matching, or what i need them for or how comfortable i want to be that day.  I have a small foot for a guy and normal in width. Not skinny and not wide. Now what i don't like about these shoes and one reason why i don't wear them very often... These shoes when you put them on feel comfortable. However, after you walk around on them you'll likely notice the soles feel like they're very thin in width. Imagine walking on a sole that feels skinnier than your foot. Your foot will very easily want to roll off the edges of the sole. Which will make you feel unstable in them. Not a good feeling and you'll fatigue your foot and be in a small amount of pain and discomfort. I'll start noticing this with just casual walking around the house. I would not recommend these to play any sports in our to go jogging or running. I originally bought them to go to the gym in. They're fine dealing with what i mentioned above here if I'm doing upper body. But, doing legs and lifting in these you're changing rolling your ankle and spraining or breaking it. I do not trust my foot to not roll off the edge of the sole. It happens when just simply walking. Let alone lifting hundreds of pounds with your legs spread shoulder width apart or so.  My favorite shoes so far honestly are trail runners. I find these types of shoes to stick like glue to almost all surfaces, they're extremely stable and you feel planted with every step you take, not to mention they have what are like cleats on the bottom. So if you happen to randomly need to walk up a grassy hill, or chase your dog wherever it decided to run off to because it got out your front door you can be sure a trail runner is gonna deliver with peak performance and your not gonna slip on almost any surface. Even wet rock.  So this shoe I'm writing the review on, will feel comfortable if you're not really having to walk in them. But if you wanna walk the mall, or dog, put go to a concert or theme park for the day i definitely do not recommend these.Read more","asin":"B07XZ8BWJX","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\">             <span>I've had these shoes for a few years now.
