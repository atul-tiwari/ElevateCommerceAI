I don't use a controller very often unless it's for something like Dark Souls or Elden Ring, and when I do, I'll usually just use whatever I have laying around. In the past, that's been an old wired Xbox 360 controller- unfortunately, the cable finally frayed and it wouldn't work anymore without some serious finagling, so I figured it was time to upgrade to something more recent.  That's where this controller comes into the picture! It's got a nice hand feel, and I like all of it's features. It comes with two joystick covers included, which is nice because they provide some extra traction. Unfortunately, I also think that they could have put a little bit more attention into the joysticks themselves, as I find them a little \"light\". I would prefer for them to have some more resistance to them, as sometimes it can feel like I'm not even pushing them, but that might just be a personal preference. The buttons come with icons printed on top, but the designs are a little strange. I guess they have to have them like that for copyright reasons. I also like the addition of a Turbo button, which allows you to quickly map inputs to the paddles on the back of the controller. This is especially useful when you need to hit the same button repeatedly, such as during quick time button mashing events, or if you need to spam jumping in something like Mario Maker. I haven't used the gyro / motion controls or the touch pad much yet, but they also seem to be very accurate. I definitely plan on using them in the future for stuff like CEMU or YUZU, where a lack of motion controls can be a severe disadvantage (I'm looking at you, BOTW puzzle shrines).  Like I said before, I normally use wired controllers, but the latency with this one doesn't seem too bad. I use a Bluetooth 5.3 adapter with my PC, and according to DS4Windows, the latency hovers around 12-13ms. I hardly notice any type of delay, but if it's absolutely necessary to have the lowest latency possible, you can also use it as a wired controller by plugging the USB-C charging cable into your PC. In this setup, the latency drops down to about 4.5ms, which is much better. Overall, I would definitely recommend this controller, and the $25-$26 price point appears to be pretty much in-line with its competitors.Read more","asin":"B0CF2NGS79","body_html":"<div data-a-expander-name=\"review_text_read_more\" data-a-expander-collapsed-height=\"300\" class=\"a-expander-collapsed-height a-row a-expander-container a-expander-partial-collapse-container\" style=\"max-height:300px\"><div data-hook=\"review-collapsed\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"a-expander-content reviewText review-text-content a-expander-partial-collapse-content\">             <span>First of all, I think that it's important to preface that I'm mainly a PC gamer.
